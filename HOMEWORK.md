# Homework
## Implement Methods (1D)
1. Implement Schwarz for two subdomains 
2. Implement nonoverlapping P.L. Lions' with Robin BCs for two subdomains
3. Implement 2. for overlapping

## Compare and contrast parameters for given functions
a. two distinct oscillation rates
b. boundary layer
c. interior layer

1. schwarz(or overlapping lions) overlap location and width
2. Lions' alpha values and boundary locations
3. (maybe) Compare schwarz and overlapping lions

## (maybe) Find a function and DD setup which breaks
Construct an f and DD setup which doesn't converge to a known solution, if possible.
This is a "maybe" because that should be the goal for the previous problem

## (maybe) Convergence Example in 2d
Construct a convergence proof and convergence rate for the 2 subdomain case (-\ifty, a) x R and (0,\ifty) x R where a > 0.
TODO: Give a few hints. The proof is fairly straightforward but there are a couple steps which would be unfair to expect them to do.
